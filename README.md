# Sudoku Project

## Overview
This project involves creating a Sudoku game and is intended as a personal template for developing future projects, facilitating learning, managing project complexity, and effectively structuring project directories and feature lists. This README serves as a comprehensive guide to understand the project's structure and its various features.

## Reference Material
The development process of this project incorporates best practices and principles outlined in the book "Code Complete". The book serves as a resource for enhancing coding practices and is extensively used throughout this project.

## Project Objectives

1. Serve as a personal learning tool, with potential to be adapted for teaching others.
2. Provide a practical approach to managing project complexity and overwhelm.
3. Organize project features effectively, including planning for future features, tracking completed features, and documenting removed features.
4. Establish a structural framework for organizing project directories based on different versions of code linked to the feature list.
5. Categorize the feature list in alignment with different versions of the code for effective project management and version control.

## Project Structure
The project's structure is intentionally designed to allow for a comprehensive view of the different versions of the code based on the list of features. Each version and corresponding feature is clearly documented and organized to facilitate an understanding of the project's evolution.

## Version Control and Features
In this project, a key focus is the effective management of different versions of code and the associated features. Each feature is categorized in accordance with its corresponding code version, ensuring a clear link between the code's evolution and the features it introduces, modifies, or removes.

## Contributing
