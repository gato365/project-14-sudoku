1) The server initializes and does a few primary tasks:
   a) Serves static files (like `index.html`, CSS, and client-side JavaScript) from a public directory using Express's `express.static` middleware.
   b) Connects to the MongoDB database via a configuration file (e.g., `connect/config`).

2) The main entry point for the user is `index.html`, which loads and executes client-side JavaScript (`app.js`). The `app.js` controls the game functionality, handling user interactions, game logic, and potentially making AJAX requests to the server for data-related operations.

3) Routes are set up on the server to handle specific requests, like saving a game or retrieving game data.
   a) These routes are linked to specific controller functions.
   b) Controllers handle the business logic, taking input from the route parameters and body, interacting with the database, and sending responses back to the client.
   c) To interact with the database, controllers rely on models.

4) Models define the shape (schema) and behavior of the data. In this context:
   a) The model `gameRecord` defines the structure of a game record (level, time taken, etc.).
   b) Using the model, the controller can perform CRUD operations on the database, like saving a new game record or retrieving existing ones.

5) When a game ends and data needs to be saved, the client-side JavaScript (`app.js`) makes a request to the appropriate server route. The route directs this request to a controller function, which uses the model to save the data in the MongoDB database.
